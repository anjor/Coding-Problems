# Coding-Problems

My attempts at solving some problems often asked in interviews/coding competitions.

1. Ascii Ruler: For a given integer n, print out an ascii ruler.
        
        For ex. - n = 1: |_|

                  n = 2: |   |
                         |_|_|

                  n = 3: |       |
                         |   |   |
                         |_|_|_|_|
